## App Link
https://cgmv-survey.netlify.app/

### Link with predefined `gamification` and `financialInformation` values

This is useful when you're testing the app with predefined treatments. Using these links will bypass the default treatment assignment logic.

- üîó [Gamification, Financial Information A](https://cgmv-survey.netlify.app/?gamification=GAMIFICATION&financialInformation=A)
- üîó [Gamification, Financial Information B](https://cgmv-survey.netlify.app/?gamification=GAMIFICATION&financialInformation=B)
- üîó [No gamification, Financial Information A](https://cgmv-survey.netlify.app/?gamification=NO_GAMIFICATION&financialInformation=A)
- üîó [No gamification, Financial Information B](https://cgmv-survey.netlify.app/?gamification=NO_GAMIFICATION&financialInformation=B)

## Animations üìΩ

You can adjust the animation duration by updating the `ANIMATION_DURATION` variable value in `survey-settings.ts` file. 

```typescript
// survey-settings.ts

// Gamification animation duration in milliseconds
// 2000 == 2 seconds
export const ANIMATION_DURATION = 2000;
```

## High-level Architecture üî≠
![App Architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1064036/116986338-47d14880-ac93-11eb-98df-e6493e35e530.png)

- This app is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). 
- Anything that the users see are deployed to Netlify.
- All data are recorded into a PostgreSQL database.
- [Hasura GraphQL engine](https://hasura.io/) is used to communicate between the app and the database.

## Continuous Deployment Requirements üî®

All commits pushed to the `main` branch are automatically deployed to Netlify. If you wish to clone this repository and deploy it to a different Netlify proejct, please see below for the requirements.

### Netlify-related Requirements üß™

- Use `netlify-plugin-nextjs` plugin to deploy Next.js serverless functions.
- The tutorial for one-click install can be found [here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/12/07/announcing-one-click-install-next.js-build-plugin-on-netlify/).
- Add a `netlify.toml` file to support `netlify-plugin-nextjs`.

### PostgreSQL + Hasura Requirements üóÑ

This web app requires a [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) GraphQL server. 

- Deploy a Hasura docker container to [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).
  - Smallest instances under $10 per month are sufficient for this web app unless there are 10,000+ concurrent connections.
- Netlify does not support requests to non-SSL domains. Configure a custom domain and enable https.
  - [Guide here](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/digital-ocean-one-click.html#adding-a-domain-enabling-https)
- Add the custom domain to `lib/apollo-client.ts`.

```typescript
export default function createApolloClient() {
  return new ApolloClient({
    uri: "https://your-hasura-domain-name/v1/graphql",
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  });
}
```
